# Project Memory — Claude Code

<!-- FILL IN: Replace every section below with your project's real content.
     Remove all comment blocks before committing.
     IMPORTANT: This file contains ONLY behavioral rules and navigation pointers.
     Technical content (entities, layer rules, naming conventions) lives in docs/ only.
     Never duplicate technical content here — if it belongs in docs/, put it there. -->

## File Loading Rules

**Never read files prefixed with `_`** — these are human-facing templates, not instructions.
**Never load `docs/progress/features/` wholesale** — read only specific files when a command requires it.
**Lazy loading:** only read a docs/ file when the current task explicitly requires it.
The files below are NOT auto-loaded — they are read on demand by slash commands only:
- `docs/architecture.md` — read when implementing or checking architecture rules
- `docs/domain-model.md` — read when touching domain entities
- `docs/decisions/index.md` — read when selecting relevant ADRs for a feature
- `docs/progress/index.md` — read at the start of every /new-feature run

## Behavioral Rules — Non-Negotiable

<!-- FILL IN: How Claude Code must behave in this project.
     Rules only — no technical architecture content.
     Examples below — replace with your own. -->

- Never run git commands — the human handles all version control
- Never make architecture decisions independently — flag conflicts, propose options, wait for confirmation
- Never read `_`-prefixed files
- Never put business logic in [your API/controller layer]
- Never reference [your infrastructure layer] from [your domain layer]
- Never commit secrets or API keys

Technical architecture rules live in `docs/architecture.md`.
